  CMake Deprecation Warning at build/_deps/sfml-src/CMakeLists.txt:5 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
    CMake.
  
    Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
    to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
    to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
  
  
  CMake Warning (dev) at C:/Program Files/CMake/share/cmake-3.31/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:441 (message):
    The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (VORBIS)
    does not match the name of the calling package (Vorbis).  This can lead to
    problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
    (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
  Call Stack (most recent call first):
